# ESP-IOT-Bridge Smart Gateway Solution

- [中文版](README_CN.md)

ESP-IOT-Bridge smart gateway solution is mainly aimed at bridging between various network interfaces in iot application scenarios, such as SPI, SDIO, USB, Wi-Fi, Ethernet and other network interfaces. ESP-IOT-Bridge is a smart gateway solution offered by Espressif. This document describes how to configure and use ESP-IOT-Bridge(the solution was originally named ESP-Gateway, because this solution does not involve protocol proxy conversion, but only data forwarding, so it is renamed ESP-IOT-Bridge).

See the README.md file in the iot_bridge component for more information about examples.
